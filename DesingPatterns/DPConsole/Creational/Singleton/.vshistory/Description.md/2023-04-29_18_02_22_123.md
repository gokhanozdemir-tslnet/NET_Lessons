In [[software engineering]], the '''singleton pattern''' is a [[software design pattern]] that restricts the [[Instantiation (computer science)|instantiation]] of a [[Class (computer programming)|class]] to a singular instance. One of the well-known [[Design Patterns|"Gang of Four" design patterns]], which describe how to solve recurring problems in [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented software]],<ref name="GoF">{{cite book |author=Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides |url=https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm/page/127 |title=Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=1994 |isbn=0-201-63361-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm/page/127 127ff] |url-access=registration}}</ref> the pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

More specifically, the singleton pattern allows objects to:<ref>{{cite web |title=The Singleton design pattern - Problem, Solution, and Applicability |url=http://w3sdesign.com/?gr=c05&ugr=proble |access-date=2017-08-16 |website=w3sDesign.com}}</ref>
* Ensure they only have one instance
* Provide easy access to that instance
* Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]] of a [[Class (computer programming)|class]])

The term comes from the [[Singleton (mathematics)|mathematical concept of a singleton]].

== Common uses ==
Singletons are often preferred to [[global variables]] because they do not pollute the global [[namespace]] (or their containing namespace). Additionally, they permit [[Lazy evaluation|lazy]] allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in many languages will always consume resources.<ref name="GoF" /><ref name="devin">{{cite news |last1=Soni |first1=Devin |date=31 July 2019 |title=What Is a Singleton? |work=BetterProgramming |url=https://betterprogramming.pub/what-is-a-singleton-2dc38ca08e92 |access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref>

The singleton pattern can also be used as a basis for other design patterns, such as the [[Abstract factory pattern|abstract factory]], [[Factory method pattern|factory method]], [[Builder pattern|builder]] and [[Prototype pattern|prototype]] patterns. [[Facade pattern|Facade]] objects are also often singletons because only one facade object is required.

[[Log file|Logging]] is a common real-world use case for singletons, because all objects that wish to log messages require a uniform point of access and conceptually write to a single source.<ref name="rainsberger">{{cite news |last1=Rainsberger |first1=J.B. |title=Use your singletons wisely |url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/co-single/ |access-date=28 August 2021 |publisher=IBM |date=1 July 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224180356/https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/co-single/ |archive-date=24 February 2021}}</ref>

== Implementations ==
Implementations of the singleton pattern ensure that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists and typically provide [[Global scope|global access]] to that instance.

Typically, this is accomplished by:
* Declaring all [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructors]] of the class to be [[Private member|private]], which prevents it from being instantiated by other objects
* Providing a [[static method]] that returns a [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] to the instance
The instance is usually stored as a private [[static variable]]; the instance is created when the variable is initialized, at some point before when the static method is first called.

This C++11 implementation is based on the pre C++98 implementation in the book.

<syntaxhighlight lang="Cpp">
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
public:
  // defines an class operation that lets clients access its unique instance.
  static Singleton& get() {
    // may be responsible for creating its own unique instance.
    if (nullptr == instance) instance = new Singleton;
    return *instance;
  }
  Singleton(const Singleton&) = delete; // rule of three
  Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&) = delete;
  static void destruct() {
    delete instance;
    instance = nullptr;
  }
  // existing interface goes here
  int getValue() {
    return value;
  }
  void setValue(int value_) {
    value = value_;
  }
private:
  Singleton() = default; // no public constructor
  ~Singleton() = default; // no public destructor
  static Singleton* instance; // declaration class variable
  int value;
};

Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr; // definition class variable

int main() {
  Singleton::get().setValue(42);
  std::cout << "value=" << Singleton::get().getValue() << '\n';
  Singleton::destruct();
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The program output is

<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
value=42
</syntaxhighlight>

This is an implementation of the Meyers singleton<ref>{{cite book |author=Scott Meyers |title=More Effective C++ |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=1997 |isbn=0-201-63371-X |pages= 146 ff}}</ref> in C++11. The Meyers singleton has no destruct method. The program output is the same as above.

<syntaxhighlight lang="Cpp">
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
public:
  static Singleton& get() {
    static Singleton instance;
    return instance;
  }
  int getValue() {
    return value;
  }
  void setValue(int value_) {
    value = value_;
  }
private:
  Singleton() = default;
  ~Singleton() = default;
  int value;
};

int main() {
  Singleton::get().setValue(42);
  std::cout << "value=" << Singleton::get().getValue() << '\n';
}
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Lazy initialization ===

A singleton implementation may use [[lazy initialization]] in which the instance is created when the static method is first invoked. In [[Multithreading (software)|multithreaded]] programs, this can cause [[Race condition|race conditions]] that result in the creation of multiple instances. The following Java example is a [[Thread safety|thread-safe]] implementation, using lazy initialization with [[double-checked locking]].

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
public class Singleton {

    private static volatile Singleton instance = null;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized(Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }

        return instance;
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

== Criticism ==
Some consider the singleton to be an [[anti-pattern]] that introduces [[global variables|global state]] into an application, often unnecessarily. This introduces a potential dependency on the singleton by other objects, requiring analysis of implementation details to determine whether a dependency actually exists.<ref name="google">{{cite web |title=Why Singletons Are Controversial |url=https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-singleton-detector/wikis/WhySingletonsAreControversial.wiki |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506162753/https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-singleton-detector/wikis/WhySingletonsAreControversial.wiki |archive-date=6 May 2021 |access-date=28 August 2021 |website=Google Code Archive}}</ref> This increased [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]] can introduce difficulties with [[unit testing]].<ref name="button">{{cite news |last1=Button |first1=Brian |date=25 May 2004 |title=Why Singletons are Evil |work=Being Scott Densmore |publisher=Microsoft |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/scottdensmore/why-singletons-are-evil |access-date=28 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210715184717/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/scottdensmore/why-singletons-are-evil |archive-date=15 July 2021}}</ref> In turn, this places restrictions on any abstraction that uses the singleton, such as preventing [[Concurrency_(computer_science)|concurrent]] use of multiple instances.<ref name="button" /><ref>Steve Yegge.

Singletons also violate the [[single-responsibility principle]] because they are responsible for enforcing their own uniqueness along with performing their normal functions.<ref name="button" />
